If you have a lot of applications, it can be a heavy operation to gather information on how many attacks were blocked and which application had the most attacks blocked. In order to reduce server load we cache the data on the dashboard for 60 minutes.

The data you see when you click on your site in the dashboard is never cached, that's all real-time.
