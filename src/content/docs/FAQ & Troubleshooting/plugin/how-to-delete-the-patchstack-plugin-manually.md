In order to manually remove the Patchstack plugin from your WordPress site, please login into the FTP of your server first, or if you have access to something such as CPanel/WHM you can find the file manager feature.

Once logged in, head to the following location **/wp-content/plugins/** and delete the folder **patchstack**.

When this is done, Patchstack will be removed from your WordPress app.
