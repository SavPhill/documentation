Rather than wait for your software to become infected we focus on preemptive measures. This allows Patchstack to be up to 10x lighter than competing (often bloated) malware scanners and still provide effective security. However, Developer and Business users can activate the Incident Response add-on and weâ€™ll clean up your application if you suspect it has become malicious.
