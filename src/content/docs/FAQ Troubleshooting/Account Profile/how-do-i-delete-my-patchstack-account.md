In order to delete your Patchstack account, please first remove all of your sites added to the Patchstack App.  
After that, navigate to your account page: <https://app.patchstack.com/settings/account>

Click on **Delete Account**. After 30 days your account will be completely terminated. You can still recover your account during that period of time.
