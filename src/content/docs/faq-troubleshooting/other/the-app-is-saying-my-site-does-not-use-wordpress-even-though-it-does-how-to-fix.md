We try to detect the CMS of the site, but this may fail.

When this happens, you can manually change the CMS to something else.

<ol><li>First go to your dashboard and click on the site in the sites overview table that has this issue.</li>
<li>Click the green gear icon next to the URL on top of the page, on the right side.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the CMS to "WordPress".</li>
<li>Click on the "Update" button.</li></ol>
