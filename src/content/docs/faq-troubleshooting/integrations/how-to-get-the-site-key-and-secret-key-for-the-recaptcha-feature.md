You have to enter your own reCAPTCHA keys in order to use the reCAPTCHA feature, here is how.

<ol><li>Login into your Google account at <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google.com</a> </li>
<li>Go here: <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create</a> </li>
<li>In the label, enter your site name.</li>
<li>Check "reCAPTCHA v2" OR "reCAPTCHA v3" depending on which reCAPTCHA version you want to use. The "reCAPTCHA v3" feature is only available in our plugin version 1.3 and up.</li>

<li>Check the checkbox to agree to the terms.</li>
