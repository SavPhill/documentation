If you are on the AppSumo plan, we strongly recommend you to upgrade your account to a Developer account, to get all the features we offer. You will still keep all the free features that you initially had on your plan.

To upgrade, you will have to navigate to your <a href="https://app.patchstack.com/billing/subscription" target="_blank">subscription page</a> and activate the **Developer** plan.

**You will not be charged anything if:**  

<ol><li>You haven't used our other paid features</lI>
<li>You haven't exceeded the application limit of your account</li></ol>
