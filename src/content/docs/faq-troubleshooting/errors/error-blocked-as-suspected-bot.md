This error might show up if visitors try to leave a comment on your site.

It is not caused by Patchstack but by a plugin called "MOJO Marketplace" or "Bluehost" as part of your Bluehost WordPress installation.

Either deactivate these plugins or reach out to your hosting company for more information as to why visitors are getting that error when they are trying to submit a comment.
