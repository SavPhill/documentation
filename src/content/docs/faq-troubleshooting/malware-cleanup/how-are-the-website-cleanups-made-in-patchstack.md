Our clean-ups are being done by technicians who will go over the whole fileserver and database and change every access code and key.

This is the only way to make sure that the site will not get reinfected and doesn't have droppers/backdoors installed.

Simple sites usually take up to 4 hours to clean up the file server and database, while more complex sites might take up to 8 hours. 

Also, Patchstack has a great add-on to avoid the situation where you need to pay extra for the cleanup.

We offer the **Incident response** which costs $9 per month / application which means we do the malware removal for free to your protected sites in case it will be hacked for any reason. 

Read more about the **Incident response** here: <a href="https://docs.patchstack.com/docs/incident-response" target="_blank">https\://docs.patchstack.com/docs/incident-response</a>
