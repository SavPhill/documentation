From the **Reports** page, you can generate PDF security reports for your sites.  
With Patchstack, you can automatically schedule your reports generation so you don't have to manually generate them.

Patchstack has 2 different types of reports available:

- **[Snapshot report](https://docs.patchstack.com/docs/snapshot-report)**  
  This is a security report about the current situation on the website. Snapshot report is a free feature for all user plans.
- **[Developer report](https://docs.patchstack.com/docs/developer-report)**  
  This is a periodic security report about the situation on the website, with security suggestions and improvements. Developer report is for the Developer and Business plan users only.

From the **Reports** page you can see all the generated reports.  
To download a report, click on the download icon that is located on the right side of the table.

To see the scheduled reports, click on **Scheduled reports** tab. Note that scheduling is for paid plans only (Developer and Business plans).
