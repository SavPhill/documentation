_Seats and team features are available on the Developer and Business plan users only._

On the **Team** page you can manage the seats. The seat management feature allows you to add sub-users to your account to which you can assign specific permissions and/or sites.  
When you add a new user, they will receive an email with a link to activate their account.

<li>Admin: Full control of all users and sites of all users, but cannot alter owners or other admins.</li>
<li>Manager: Full control of all sites of all users, cannot modify users.</li>
<li>Member: Read and write access to sites assigned to this user, cannot modify users or delete sites.</li></ol>

After adding the user, you can see the added user in the table below.  
An invitation was sent to that email asking to register an account on Patchstack App.

For that, navigate to the **Applications** subpage under **Team**.
