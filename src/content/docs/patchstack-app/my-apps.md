## Overview of your WordPress apps

You can see the quick overview of each of your WordPress application from the **My Apps** view.  
Let's go through some more important table columns to explain the data shown.

- **Status** - shows whether the site is properly connected. Hover over the dot with your cursor, to see extra details
  - Green: Patchstack plugin is properly connected
  - Yellow: Firewall has been turned off
  - Red: Patchstack plugin is not connected
- **Group** - shows to which groups that site has been attached to. Attaching your apps to custom groups makes it easier to manage them. For example you could group them by care plans you offer.
- **Protection** - shows which protection modules are activated for the application. Note that if you are not on any paid plan, you can see a toggle which lets you activate the protection on that site. Otherwise:
  - VP - vPatching module
  - AH - Advanced Hardening module
  - OW - Generic protection module
- **Threats blocked** - this graph is a visual representation of the volume of blocked threats in the last 7 days.
- **Software** - how many third party software is installed in this particular site (like plugins, themes or WordPress core)
- **Vulnerabilities** - how many vulnerabilities are currently present on your website
- **Outdated** - how many of the third party software are outdated and need updating
