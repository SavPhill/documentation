_This add-on is for the Developer and Business plan users only._  
<https://app.patchstack.com/addons>

While your site is protected and regularly updated, it can still be in danger, if not everything is maintained properly.  
Example reasons why sites could still get hacked:

- Use of weak passwords, which are easily guessed
- Your password has leaked to third parties
- Multiple WordPress installations on one server, some of which are unprotected by a firewall

In case of a security issue, we will have our forensics team step in, collect evidence, safely clean up and restore the website and create a report to help you improve the security of your sites even more.
