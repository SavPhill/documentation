_This feature is accessible for the Developer and Business plan users._

You can attach your domains to multiple groups.  
Grouping makes it easier to distinguish your domains from each other.

For example, if it is important to know, where the website/application is hosted, you can attach it to a group (e.g. call it GoDaddy, Hostinger, Plesk...)

## Creating a Group

To create a group, click on a plus sign at the groups column in the **My Apps** view.  
You can give this group a name, attach the firewall rule modules to it, and select your applications, which should belong to that group. Use the toggle buttons!

When done, click **Done**.

To read more about the custom firewall modules, check the **Protection** page in the Patchstack App.
