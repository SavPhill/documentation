_This feature is for the Developer and Business plan users only._  
**[https://app.patchstack.com/reports/](https://app.patchstack.com/reports/)**

If you have clients to whom you want to send reports regularly, scheduling the reports can be highly beneficial. The reports will be generated automatically and can be accessed from the Patchstack App at any time.  
Reports will be available for download on the Reports page.

Note that report scheduling is a paid feature of Patchstack.

## Creating a report schedule
